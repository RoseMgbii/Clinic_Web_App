Breadcrumb Navigation in website design and creation
The term "breadcrumb" in the context of a webpage refers to a navigational aid that helps users understand the hierarchy and structure of a website. Breadcrumbs typically appear near the top of a webpage and display a trail of links, representing the path from the homepage to the current page.

The term "breadcrumb" is derived from the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale, where breadcrumbs are used to mark a trail through the forest.
Similarly, on a website, breadcrumbs provide users with a trail of links to easily navigate back to higher-level pages or the homepage.

For example, a breadcrumb trail for a product page on an e-commerce website might look like this:
Home > Category > Subcategory > Product. In our case, in the create.blade.php file under the doctor folder,
We have
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <nav class="breadcrumb-container" aria-label="breadcrumb">
                    <ol class="breadcrumb">
                        <li class="breadcrumb-item">
                            <a href="../index.html"><i class="ik ik-home"></i></a>
                        </li>
                        <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Doctor</a></li>
                        <li class="breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">Create</li>
                    </ol>
                </nav>
            </div>
This div creates the breadcrumb in the page header,
And the breadcrumb looks like this: Home > Doctor > Create OR Home / Doctor / Create

Users can click on any part of the breadcrumb trail to quickly navigate to a higher-level page.
Breadcrumbs are a useful feature for enhancing the user experience and making website navigation more intuitive.
